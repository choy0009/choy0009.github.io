Although, I've become quicker and overall better at coding and everything that comes with it, I still face challenges while completing assignments. For this one, I ran into some trouble while attemping to create a hamburger menu for my mobile screen size. After spending at least an hour trying to work it out I decided to just create a stacked navigation like I normally do for my mobile screens because it is something I know how to do and that I know I could pull off. Overall, I found a way to overcome most of the challenges I faced while working on this assignment and came up with workarounds for the ones that I didn't.

While creating this site, I learnt how to create a contact form in a different way than I had been doing throughout the semester. I tried out a different style because I wanted to challenge myself and now I have learnt something new.

All of the fonts I used are from Google Fonts and all of the images are from Google Images (except for the photo of myself, of course).
